# This MQTT client library works with verified middleware
# current available options for middlewares :
# * Linux
# * ESP8266_AT_parser (ESP8266 AT library, with FreeRTOS)

middleware  ESP8266_AT_parser

# For developers who want to use other third-party cryptography library, they can add new option and
# integrate files of the new cryptography library into this MQTT library.
# current available options for cryptography library:
# * libtomcrypt (default)

cryptolib  libtomcrypt

# enable TLS protocol in this MQTT library or not, default is yes

tls  yes

# paths to your certificate / private key that will be used for authentication during TLS
# handshake processes.
# This project only supports DER-encoded X509 certificate and private key files, the code
# generation script simply copies raw hex bytes from every DER file (specified below) to
# global char-array variable. PEM-encoded files have to be converted to DER-encoded format
# beforehand using any tools like OpenSSL utility.

# For mutual (2-way) authentication, client's private key and (non-CA) certificate
# have to be specified

# MQTT broker address

# For some middlewares / hardware platforms that don't provide current date / time in real world
# , One can specify the expected date / time on the system initialization, or simply get current
# date time from underlying OS
# For example :
#     sysinithour       11
#     sysinitminutes    8
#     sysinitseconds    30
#     sysinitmonth      2
#     sysinitdate       5
#     sysinityear       2019

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# For some middlewares that don't have file system (e.g. RTOS running on microcontroller-based embedded
# device), some data may be stored in memory of the target embedded device.

# wifi username and password, essential for ESP8266_AT_parser, optional for other middlewares.

# The operating system used on the target hardware (e.g., freertos-v10).
# This is used by the build system to include OS-specific headers and link against OS libraries.
os  freertos-v10

# The specific hardware platform (e.g., stm32f446).
# This helps the build system select the correct platform-specific makefiles and configurations.
hw_platform  stm32f446

# Path to the root directory of your RTOS hardware build environment (e.g., rtos-playground).
# This is crucial for embedded builds as it provides access to RTOS-specific build scripts, includes, and libraries.

# Path to the home directory of the ESP8266 AT parser project.
# This is specifically required when 'middleware' is set to 'ESP8266_AT_parser' to locate necessary ESP-AT related files.

# Path to the base directory of your cross-compilation toolchain (e.g., ARM GNU toolchain).
# This is essential for embedded builds to correctly invoke the cross-compiler, assembler, and linker.
